Hello, this is the manual to my ToDo List App:

you will need:
1) Spring Boot v2.4.0 or higher.
2) Node.js installed to run (npm start) on the WebApp(React).

Start:
1) open the project with a text editor and run the spring boot,
he will connect to the mongo atlas and run it on ip-(http://localhost:8080/).
2) open "CMD" on WebApp path and type (npm start)
it will run the webApp on IP-(http://localhost:3000/).
3) open browser on URL: 'http://localhost:3000/'
and have fun :))



unfortunately, I have no time to learn Redux and implement it sorry about that,
but if you will like the app and you will want to move forward with my position 
I promise to integrate Redux in 1 day :)
I have learned and understand the principles of it:
instead of props, you have a class of "global vars"

I wanted to add good documentation but this week was really intense
and I can't take more time...

there is a couple of bugs that I found but didn't have time to fix:
1) sortBy doesn't work because props send/receive. 
2) forgo to add the "DONE" button to update it.
3)didn't add client functionality 


thanks for the opportunity of this position and have a great new 2021 year!!!!
